White hair and hair fall usually come from stress, weak nutrition, hormonal imbalance, and poor scalp care. To manage them, focus on a high-protein diet with enough vitamin B12, iron, and zinc. Use mild, sulfate-free shampoo and avoid heat styling. Apply coconut, onion, or rosemary oil twice a week to strengthen roots. Proper sleep, hydration, and reducing stress quickly improve hair quality. Gentle scalp massage boosts blood flow and slows greying. Reducing sugar and smoking also prevents premature white hair.
